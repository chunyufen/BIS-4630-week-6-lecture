# Inroduction to financial markets

&gt; "Financial markets have the role of facilitating the movement of funds among people and organisation. The _surplus units_ (e.g. funds suppliers) are seeking to generate returns (profits) by supplying their funds to the _deficit units_ (e.g. the borrowers) . . . Financial markets are classified into _primary_ and _secondary_ markets. The former is used by deficit units such as businesses, governments and households to raise funds for the expenditure of goods, services and assets. The latter is used by surplus units such as the investors to trade what has been bought in the primary market."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Inroduction to financial markets

&gt; "Financial markets are also classified into _money markets_ and _captial markets_. . . Companies that need to raise capital by offering new stocks use the primary market. The new stocks can include initial public offerings (IPOs), right issues, placement and company options. Once these newly issued stocks are sold in the primary market, they can continue to be traded through the secondary market, called the _stock exchange market_. Capital market participants include traders (e.g. investors), intermediaries (e.g. brokers), statutory authorities (e.g. securities commissions) and third parties such as commercial information vendors (e.g. Bloomberg or Reuters)"&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Inroduction to financial markets

&gt; "The regulation of insider dealing under United Kingdom law traditionally had the objective of protecting shareholders against the misuse of privileged or confidential information belonging to the company by corporate insiders who were in a position to utilize the information for their gain at the expense of the company and its shareholders. In contrast, regulatory controls on market manipulation were designed to prevent misleading statements and practices concerning issuers and their securities and behaviours that would distort the markets."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

]

---

# Insider trading (not legal definition)

&gt; "where someone obtains privileged access to market-sensitive information ahead of others and seeks to exploit that information advantage for his own or another’s benefit before the rest of the market becomes aware of that information. This also encompasses the misuse of such information through disclosure to a third party"&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Market manipulation (not legal definition)

&gt; "where market prices and/or trading volumes are distorted either by someone misleading others in the market through their statements or conduct or by someone unfairly exploiting their ability to move market prices to their own advantage."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Factors affecting value of stocks

* Demand and supply

&gt; “Prices are set by the forces of supply and demand, and buyers and sellers are free to exploit whatever information they can lawfully obtain.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

* Quality and availability of information about issuing companies

* Insider information

    + Falsely influences price

    + Takes unfair advantage of information imbalance

# Objectives for control

* Need for the marketplace to be fair, efficient and transparent

* Fair market means access to the same pool of information

* Same information produces different perceptions of value from different opinions and analysis

---

# Is it a good reason

* Fairness (do little to advance the case for banning insider trading)

&gt; ". . . insider trading is "a manifestation of undue greed among the already well-to-do, worthy of legislative intervention if for no other reason than to send a message of censure on behalf of the American people." . . . We might define fairness as fidelity, for example, by . . . an agent should not cheat her principal. But this argument only has traction if insider trading is in fact a form of cheating, which in turn depends on how we assign the property right to confidential corporate information. Alternatively, we might define fairness as equality of access to information, . . . but this definition must be rejected in light of Chiarella's rejection of the Texas Gulf Sulphur equal access standard. Finally, we might define fairness as a prohibition of injuring another. But such a definition justifies an insider trading prohibition only if insider trading injures investors, which seems unlikely."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

---

# Is it a good reason

* Injury to investors

&gt; "If a firm’s stock currently sells at $10 per share, but after disclosure of the new information will sell at $15, a shareholder who sells at the current price thus will claim a $5 loss. The investor’s claim, however, is fundamentally flawed. . . . The gain corresponding to the shareholder’s loss is reaped not just by inside traders, but by all contemporaneous purchasers whether they had access to the undisclosed information or not."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Surveillance Analysis of Business Reporting

&gt; “Market surveillance is facilitated by computer systems that try to detect illegal market behaviours that violate the market regulations. Surveillance systems should have access to every piece of real-time or historic market information. For example, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in UK is tendering for a supplier to upgrade its SABRE surveillance system. SMARTS is a universal surveillance system that is used in more than 16 countires.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

* SMARTS:

    + Jakarta, HK, Swiss, Tokyo Commodities Exchange, SE of Thailand, Singapore, etc.

* X-STREAM:

    + Asia Pacific Stock Exchange, Saudi Stock Exchange, Philippine, etc

# History in UK - insider dealing offence

&gt; "Until 1980, the restrictions on insider dealing in the United Kingdom were extremely limited. There was no specific legislation other than the requirements in the Companies Acts for directors, members of their families and substantial shareholders to report dealings in the shares of their companies. . . . The Companies Act 1980 included the specific criminal offence of insider dealing in limited circumstances (sections 68 - 73 of the Companies Act 1980). . .The scope of criminal liability for the insider dealing offence was widened under Part V of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 (CJA 1993) . . . enacted as a result of the . . . implementation of the 1990 European Community Insider Dealing Directive."

# History in UK - insider dealing offence

&gt; "The CJA 1993 prohibited three classes of conduct in certain circumstances (by section 52): (1) dealings in price-affected securities based on inside information; (2) encouraging another to deal in price-affected securities based on inside information; and (3) knowingly disclosing inside information to another. . . . Regarding market manipulation, the Financial Services Act 1986 created two criminal offences consisting of (1) misleading statements (section 47(1)), and (2) misleading practices (section 47(2))."

# History in UK - market abuse offence

&gt; "In 2000, the UK Parliament enacted the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which created a civil offence for market abuse, enhanced criminal penalties for insider dealing, and created three criminal offences (sections 397(1) to (3)) for misleading statements and practices. Section 118 FSMA created three distinct categories for the market abuse offence: (1) misuse of information; (2) creating false or misleading impressions; and (3) market distortion. Unlike the abvoe criminal offences, the market abuse offence could be enforced in regulatory administrative proceedings in which unlimited civil penalities could be imposed based on a lower evidentiary standard defined as the regular use test." (brackets added)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# History: EU insider dealing &amp; market manipulation directive

&gt; "The EU Insider Dealing and Market Manipulation Directive (Directive 2003/6/EC of 28 January 2003) has defined insider dealing as a form of market abuse that can constitute both a civil and a criminal offence . . . The UK regulations implementating the Directive replace the original sections 118(2)(a) - (c) . . . Rather than having three definitions of abusive behaviour in section 118, there are now seven categories . . . "&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Insider dealing - introduction

---

# Why regulate (1)

* The equality of information argument

&gt; “Organised financial markets such as the public securities market depend on the public disclosure of information to all investors (or potential investors) on a timely, equal and simultaneous basis. Confidence in these markets (and investors willingness to enter them) would be harmed if those who obtain access to inside information before it is announced to others are permitted to benefit from it by dealing in the securities in question.” &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Anderson, et al., A Practitioner’s Guide to the Law and Regulation of Market Abuse, Chapter 1
]

---

# Why regulate (2)

* The fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary argument

&gt; “This starts from the premise that the directors and officers of a company or other entity that issues public securities owe their duties to investors (or would-be investors) in those securities and must therefore be required to disclose material, non-public information they have about the issuer before trading for their own personal benefit. The argument has then been extended to say that any person who has been entrusted with material, non-public information through their employment, office, profession etc should be restricted from making use of that information for their own personal benefit on the securities market.” &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Insiders (types of insiders)

* A person has information as an insider if:

    + it is, and he knows that it is, inside information, and

    + he has it, and knows that he has it, from an inside source

    + A primary insider is any person who by virtue of their employment with a company comes into possession of insider information

    + e.g. a director, employee or shareholder of a company that has issued securities, and who is in possession of the information by virtue of their involvement with the company

    + Secondary insiders are generally call *tippees*: persons who receive information, either directly or indirectly, which they know is inside information as it has come from or via a source which obtained that information by virtue of their employment or position, and act upon it

  + (b) that, although he had such an expectation at the time, he did not expect the dealing to result in a profit attributable to the fact that the information was price-sensitive information in relation to the securities.

---

# Aim (1)

* Keeps pace with developments and deals with commodity and derivative markets: “The market abuse regulation (MAR) seeks to ensure that European Union (EU) regulation keeps pace with market developments in order to combat market abuse on financial markets as well as across commodity and related derivative markets (i.e. markets trading primary products such as gold, wheat, etc., and financial instruments based thereupon).”

* Bans expressly manipulation of benchmarks: “It explicitly bans the manipulation of benchmarks (such as the London Interbank Offered Rate - known as the LIBOR).”

---

# Aim (2)

* Reinforce investigation and sanction:“It reinforces the investigative and sanctioning powers of the regulators appointed by EU countries to ensure the proper functioning of their financial markets.”

* EU-wide: “It ensures a single EU rulebook while reducing administrative burdens on smaller and medium-sized issuers where possible.”

---

# Key points

* Banning abuse in financial markets

    + market manipulation

    + insider dealing

    + unlawful disclosure of non-public information

* Administrative sanctions

    + Require EU countries to specify administrative pecuniary sanctions of at least €15 million or 15 % of the total annual turnover for legal persons (such as companies) and of €5 million for individuals, to be applied by the competent authorities.

* Investigator power

    + Regulators are able to carry out on-site inspections and investigations and to request the freezing or sequestration of assets

---

# Implementation date: 3 July 2016 except:

* Organized trading facilities (OTF)

* Small medium sized enterprises (SME)

* Growth markets

* Emission allowances, establishing minimum thresholds of carbon dioxide equivalent and rated thermal output

* MAR is supplemented by technical standards and guidance published by the European Securities and Markets Authority

---

# MAR has a wider scope (Article 2):

* Beyond regulated markets to financial instruments traded on multi-lateral trading facilities (MTF) and organised trading facilities (OTF), and includes those instruments traded over-the-counter (OTC) if they affect the value or price of financial instruments on trading venues

* Extend to emission allowances which are brought fully within the regime as they are treated as financial instruments under MiFID II (which takes effect from 3 January 2018)

* Extend to spot commodity contracts (that are not wholesale energy contracts), where there is likely to be an effect on the price or value of a financial instrument

---

# Territorial jurisdiction

&gt; There is no requirement for persons to be within the UK or other EEA state for an offence to be committed. Conduct engaged in entirely outside the EEA is therefore caught, provided that it relates to products that are within scope (or conduct that could affect the price of such products).

---

# Consequential

* Consequential to MAR, FCA Handbook of rules and guidance are amended

    + FCA published [Market Abuse Regulation Instrument 2016](http://bit.ly/2h9K2RC) to amend SYSC

    + For example, [amended part of the Handbook on Market Conduct (MAR Market Conduct)](http://bit.ly/2gqL5yt)

---

# Market abuse offences

* Prohibition of insider dealing

    + A person shall not engage or attempt to engage in insider dealing; Article 14(a)

    + A person shall not recommend or induce another person to engage in insider dealing: Article 14(b)

* Prohibition of unlawful disclosure of inside information

    + A person shall not unlawfully disclose inside information: Article 14(c)

* Prohibition of market manipulation

    + A person shall not engage in or attempt to engage in market manipulation: Article 15

---

# Implementation and Interpretation

&gt; Although the EU Market Abuse Regulation (“MAR”) will result in the repeal of s.118 of the FSMA from 3 July 2016 and will substitute a set of directly applicable EU civil market abuse offences, the interpretation of s.118 of the FSMA will nonetheless remain relevant to historic behaviour that has occurred prior to that date but is subject to enforcement action after it. In addition, HM Treasury is proposing to amend s.129 of the FSMA as part of the UK implementation of MAR, to allow applications to the court seeking the imposition of penalties in connection with breaches of MAR where the FCA has also applied for an injunction to restrain market abuse. Therefore, the interpretation of the court’s powers and many of the procedural elements of that provision in the FSMA will remain relevant in the future.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Flows of confidential and inside information

---

# Introduction

&gt; Financial services firms regularly receive, handle and generate large amounts of confidential and inside information as a result of the business they conduct.

&gt; Employees at all levels should understand their role in controlling flows of confidential and inside information and make it an integral part of how they carry out their work.

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; [FCA, Flows of Confidential and Inside Information, December 2015](http://bit.ly/2zmPEUx)
]

---

# Three lines of defence:

&gt; The first line of defence includes management, front office and support functions that are responsible and accountable for its day-to-day activities, management of risks and controls to mitigate the risks of the business with senior management taking overall accountability across the firm.

&gt; The second line of defence includes the global functions such as Risk and Compliance and is responsible for providing assurance, challenge and oversight of the activities of the first line of defence.

&gt; The third line of defence is Internal Audit which provides independent assurance over the first and second lines of defence.

]

---

# Need to know

&gt; ‘Need to know’ is a frequently used principle within the financial services industry. To appreciate how to best apply it, firms may want to consider only sharing confidential and inside information where certain criteria are met. Employees disclosing information should always ensure that they take into account the best interests of the client, and identify and manage any potential conflicts of interest that may arise either between (i) the firm and a client of the firm or (II) one client of the firm and another client.

]

---

# A. Circumstances Posing Heightened Risk

&gt; Changes to a firm’s business model or rapid growth will likely pose new conduct risks, including around managing flows of information. Firms would benefit from considering and to the extent possible, mitigating these from the outset.

&gt; Bad practices:

&gt; Firms had not thought sufficiently about change of business model and rapid growth of business.


.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; [FCA, Flows of Confidential and Inside Information, December 2015](http://bit.ly/2zmPEUx)
]

---

# B. Conduct, Culture and Responsibility

&gt; Flows of confidential and inside information are adequately controlled, though ultimate responsibility sits with senior management.

&gt; Bad practices:

&gt; Senior management responsibility and accountability in managing flows of information was not always clear and understood;
Employees at some firms shared information without adequate deliberation

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; [FCA, Flows of Confidential and Inside Information, December 2015](http://bit.ly/2zmPEUx)
]

---

# C. Firm Systems, Procedures and Infrastructure

&gt; Robust systems, procedures and infrastructure underpin the effective management of flows of confidential and inside information in firms.

&gt; Bad practices:

&gt; Our review found some firms had not adequately considered the risks of locating employees with conflicting roles or responsibilities in close physical proximity to each
other.

&gt; While firms used both manual and automated surveillance mechanisms around flows of information, these were not always fit for purpose. Both policies and procedures at some firms were not user-friendly and training was at times inadequately tailored to the needs of employees.
